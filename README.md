#First module created by azerus and push on npm

Inside the project you will find an index.js, test.js and and json package ( due to the npm init).

#How did i made that module ?

First create a new repo on github and clone it on your computer.

Easy right ? now open your terminal in the folder you've just cloned and tape "npm init".

Choose a project name and press enter, same to the version of your module ( keep 0.0.1 'cause when you gonna patch it the last version number will be increment ) take some tags a description.

# Fine folk's but did we also finished ?

Buddy it depend of you and the librairy where you wanna work with... you are the developer of that app so you are the only one who know that ;)
